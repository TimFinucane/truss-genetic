truss-genetic v1.0

SUMMARY
This is a computerised approach to creating an optimal planar truss designed to carry a point load using a genetic algorithm. 
This application is NO LONGER being worked upon and is merely an example of using genetic algorithms for truss building.
Do not expect it to be optimised completely, or suitable for commercial applications or serious truss building.
